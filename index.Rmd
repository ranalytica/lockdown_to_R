# Overview

This is my journey during Covid 19 lock-down in the US and how I was able to learn R programming through [Coursera - JHU Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) program.  

The program consist of 10 courses that covers the following:

1. **The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox**
2. **R Programming**
3. **Getting and Cleaning Data**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
5. **Reproducible Research**
6. **Statistical Inference**
7. **Regression Models**
8. **Practical Machine Learning**
9. **Developing Data Products**
10. **Data Science Capstone**

It was March 2020 when I signed up for Coursera Plus subscription.
